title: MWL Reading Group
---

We're reading research papers about various topics in machine learning and
artificial intelligence. Meetings will be informal, reading-group style; likely
there will be one or two people assigned to lead a "discussion" about the
readings, and we will talk about things that we found interesting or did not
quite understand in the papers.

**We're planning on meeting for 1.5-2 hours on Tuesdays at 6:30 PM in CSE 503**

## Suggested Prerequisites

In order to get a lot out of this, participants probably will want to have taken
a course in either natural language processing, machine learning, artificial
intelligence, or computer vision; most concepts should be comprehensible to
people with a solid probability and mathematics background, however.

  - [Ferguson, Dave and Anthony Stentz. "Anytime RRTs."](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0978/cf6a89df6b6146c93550621d39f95c838175.pdf)
  
### January 10th: 80's Deep Learning (or: Deep Learning Then and Now)
  - [Hochreiter, Sepp and Jürgen Schmidhuber. "Long Short-Term Memory"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/744d/cb85b8a36a7cf6b382ba100965de717ebe91.pdf)
    - Original LSTM Paper, only the first 11 pages should be relevant, so you're
      not required to read beyond that
    - [This blog post (by Christopher Olah)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
      is great for understanding how recurrent neural nets (RNNs) and LSTMs
      work, would highly recommend reading!
  - [Cho, Kyunghyun et al. "Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e2ce/a79e832e0fe999efba16fd621f84cd322371.pdf)
    - Introduces a modern variant of the LSTM called the Gated Recurrent Unit
      (GRU)
  - [Lecun, Yann et al. "Gradient-based Learning Applied to Document Recognition."](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1cf/aea6c9b1d42aa823137bb33cea3d01c6536e.pdf)
    - Original Convolutional Neural network paper beyond theory - only the first
      12-15 pages should be relevant, so you're not required to read beyond
      that.
    - [This blog post (by Andrej Karpathy)](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/10/25/selfie/)
      is great for getting an intuition on convolutional neural networks.
  - [Krizhevsky, Alex et al. "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks."](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2315/fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc.pdf)
    - Seminal paper on classifying images with deep learning, generally agreed
      to be the paper that kickstarted the modern deep learning era
  - [extra credit paper if you're interested: Józefowicz, Rafal et al. "An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures."](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/324f/c9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede.pdf)
  - [Entertaining (?) article about Jürgen Schmidhuber's thoughts on his lack of recognition in modern deep learning, with commentary by Yann LeCun and others.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/technology/artificial-intelligence-pioneer-jurgen-schmidhuber-overlooked.html)
