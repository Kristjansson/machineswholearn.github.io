title: MWL Reading Group
---

We're reading research papers about various topics in machine learning and
artificial intelligence. Meetings will be informal, reading-group style; likely
there will be one or two people assigned to lead a "discussion" about the
readings, and we will talk about things that we found interesting or did not
quite understand in the papers.

**We're planning on meeting for 1-1.5 hours on Thursdays at 5:30 PM in CSE 503**

## Suggested Prerequisites

In order to get a lot out of this, participants probably will want to have taken
a course in either natural language processing, machine learning, artificial
intelligence, or computer vision; most concepts should be comprehensible to
people with a solid probability and mathematics background, however.
