title: MWL Reading Group

We're reading research papers about various topics in machine learning and
artificial intelligence. Meetings will be informal, reading-group style; likely
there will be one or two people assigned to lead a "discussion" about the
readings, and we will talk about things that we found interesting or did not
quite understand in the papers.

**Content is forthcoming for 2017-2018**
