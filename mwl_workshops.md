title: MWL Workshops
---

In MWL Workshops, our goal understand how various machine learning algorithms
work; unravelling the black boxes behind library functions is important for
figuring out how to improve your models and why things may not look as expected.

We're planning to spend two weeks on each method. The first week will be a
discussion about how the method works under the hood through a mixture of theory
and intuition. The second week, we'll be working together and coding up the
algorithm from scratch to solve a given problem.

We expect participants to be able to program in Python. While UW's introductory
programming courses often do not use the language, it's quite popular for data
science / machine learning and is worth picking up. There are plenty of great
resources for learning how to write Python code online, so we'll avoid spending
time on that in our sessions; check out the
[section in the README of our lecture repository](https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn/lectures/blob/master/README.md#software)
for some more info. We also expect participants to have knowledge of basic
concepts in probability.

We're planning on meeting weekly for one hour.
