title: MWL Workshops
---

We're revamping the workshops a bit. In the past, we've favored "curriculums" 
with logical flows through a body of material. This had its benefits and downsides, 
but the biggest flaw was that many participants felt like they were hosed if they 
missed even one week.

To this end, we'll be just doing talks about a variety of topics, aimed at a variety 
of skill levels. We think that in this way, everyone can get something out of it.

## Suggested Prerequisites

We expect participants to be able to program in Python. While UW's introductory
programming courses don't use the language, it's quite popular for data science
/ machine learning and is very worth picking up. There are plenty of great
resources for learning how to write Python code online, so we'll avoid spending
time on that in our sessions; check out the
[section in the README of our lecture repository](https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn/lectures/blob/master/README.md#software)
for some more info.

**We're planning on meeting for an hour on Mondays at 5:30 PM**
