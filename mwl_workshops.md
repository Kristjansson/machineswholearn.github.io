title: MWL Workshops
---

We're revamping the workshops a bit. In the past, we've favored "curriculums" 
with logical flows through a body of material. This had its benefits and downsides, 
but the biggest flaw was that many participants felt like they were hosed if they 
missed even one week.

To this end, we'll be just doing talks about a variety of topics, aimed at a variety 
of skill levels. We think that in this way, everyone can get something out of it.

## Suggested Prerequisites

We expect participants to be able to program in Python. While UW's introductory
programming courses don't use the language, it's quite popular for data science
/ machine learning and is very worth picking up. There are plenty of great
resources for learning how to write Python code online, so we'll avoid spending
time on that in our sessions; check out the
[section in the README of our lecture repository](https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn/lectures/blob/master/README.md#software)
for some more info.

**We're planning on meeting for an hour on Mondays at 5:30 PM**

### Data Hack Nights
While lecture / workshop-based talks are a great way to get an introduction to a new subject, the fastest way to become proficient is to actually use it! Many of us agree that we've learned the most about data science / machine learning from personal projects and generally hacking on data-related things in our free time. In an effort to encourage this sort of experiental, independent learning, we'll be holding "Data Hack Nights", where anyone is free to come, hang out, and work on a data science / machine learning related project. We'll be around to help you out if you get stuck, and we're happy to chat if you are having trouble figuring out what to do / getting started.
