The goal of this group is to gain a deeper understand some of the core
mathematics and statistics behind machine learning. To this end, we'll be
working through Sheldon Axler's
[*Linear Algebra Done Right*](http://linear.axler.net/).

The rationale for studying linear algebra when MATH 308 is readily available 
to all members of the UW community is that MATH 308, as taught by some professors 
at least, focuses heavily on computation and very little on elements that are 
relevant to machine learning (i.e. eigenvalues are briefly covered near the end of 
the course, and tensor factorization is not touched). Linear algebra is quite 
important in many subfields of machine 
learning, especially recent deep learning methods that are generally expressed as 
tensor and matrix operations. Thus, we'll try to tie in relevant elements from machine 
learning.

**We're planning on meeting at 5:30 PM on Tuesdays, generally in CSE303**

## Suggested Prerequisites 
We'd like for participants to have already taken MATH308, and just want a deeper 
understanding of the material. The book is fairly self-contained, though, so
you should be fine as long as you've taken calculus.
