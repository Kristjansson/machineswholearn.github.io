The goal of this group is to gain a deeper understand some of the core
mathematics and statistics behind machine learning. To this end, we'll be
working through Larry Wasserman's
[*All of Statistics*](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/).

We'll plan to spend two weeks on each chapter. The first week, participants will
be expected to have read the chapter and have made a sincere attempt at
understanding the concepts. We'll meet to discuss the material, in order to
clear up any misconceptions / cement our understanding. The second week,
participants will be expected to have worked through some problem sets, and come
ready to discuss their solutions / how they work. We're drawing problems from
CMU's
[36-705 (Intermediate Statistics)](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/),
which is a course that heavily uses the book.

Chapters 1-5 cover a little bit more than the material in a class like CSE 312,
but is likely to be a much more mathematically intense approach. It's our hope
that working through the proofs and the gritty math behind much of "basic"
probability will enhance the intuitions you have about the subject.

**We're planning on meeting for 1-1.5 hours on Fridays at 5:30 PM in CSE 503**

## Suggested Prerequisites
We expect participants to have a strong understanding of calculus (so up to MATH
126); prior experience with probability and statistics helps, but is not
necessary. *All of Statistics* is a pretty mathematically rigorous text, and
approaches probability and proofs of the concepts through calculus.

## Winter Quarter 2017 (Tentative) Schedule
**On days that we talk about homework, you're highly encouraged to read ahead to the 
next chapter! Each of these chapters has a large amount of complex material, and it 
might take more than a week to fully digest.**
