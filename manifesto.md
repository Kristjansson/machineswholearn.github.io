## On Prerequisites


Machine learning / AI / data science requires a certain prerequisite skill set
to get started. We think it's beyond that scope of the group to do things like
teach everyone Python or calculus --- there are plenty of great online resources
that do it better than we could, and it probably isn't the best use of our time
together. That being said, we'd be happy to advise on how to get started and put
together study groups for people interested in learning prerequisites together
if that's something that is suggested.

## Good Use of Your Time

Covering a lot of material naturally takes a considerable amount of time. We
want this to be a good use of your time, because we think that everyone deserves
to feel this way. Here some strategies for this:

You *must* do background reading (for things like MWL Foundational and Reading
Group) beforehand. This is essential for keeping sessions productive. If you
can’t, catch up and come to the next session. If you fall behind on one topic,
you can wait until the next topic.

Feel free to come only for areas (e.g. textbooks) or topics (e.g. chapters)
you’re interested in and want to cover.

If relevant, only one person should take notes. The organizers will generally do
this, though if anyone has a strong interest, we can alternate. Obviously no one
is forbidden from taking notes, but the way it's done in class is a waste of
time: everyone copying everything down takes the collective focus off of what’s
going on.

## Compile a Reference

We hope to keep running log online of core concepts we cover and good visualizations we come up with. This will be something everyone can access and print. Hopefully this will be more [a] relevant, [b] easy to understand, and [c] easy to access than flipping through textbooks.

## Feedback Early; Fail Fast

We doubt this will be perfect on the first meeting, and we want to open the forum for both discussions and anonymous feedback on the format—what we cover, how we cover it, how often we meet, who leads—from the get go.

## Safe Space for Extremely Dumb Questions 

I (Nelson) will do my best to lead the charge on this. My mathematics background
is thin, and I’m shaky on many of the fundamentals utilized in ML. No one should
feel embarrassed to admit not understanding any concept covered. There are
several requirements to meet this goal:

- no faculty should be present for these meetings
- the group should be kept intimate
- we must be vigilant in keeping each other positive and supportive.
