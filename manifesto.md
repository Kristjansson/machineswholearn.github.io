## On Prerequisites

Machine learning / AI / data science requires a certain prerequisite skill set
to get started. We think it's beyond the scope of the group to do things like
teach everyone Python or calculus --- there are plenty of great online resources
that do it better than we could, and it probably isn't the best use of our time
together. That being said, we'd be happy to advise on how to get started and put
together study groups for people interested in learning prerequisites together
if that's something that is suggested.

## On Software and Libraries

It might be odd that we aren't teaching how to use libraries like scikit-learn,
tensorflow / torch / theano, or keras. This is intentional - we believe that
learning libraries is an area that already has a lot of tutorials / resources;
it's thus not in our best interests to reduplicate the effort. Learning software
packages should be done after having an understanding of how the methods work,
and will indeed be much easier after doing so.

That's not to say we aren't against applying your knowledge --- that's
definitely something that's very important in furthering your understanding, and
lots of data science is practice. We just believe that the knowledge of how the
code works is far more important and valuable; anyone can initialize a
classifier in scikit-learn and train it, but few people have the knowledge to
rationalize its decisions and use their knowledge of how it works to improve
performance.

## On Learning and Understanding

We want participants to gain a deep understanding of the things we cover. To quote [Andrej Karpathy's advice for undergraduates]():

> Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content. Even I
> often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book
> and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You
> will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that
> many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use
> different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can
> actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them
> at will.

## Good Use of Your Time

Covering a lot of material naturally takes a considerable amount of time. We
want everyone involved to feel like Machines Who Learn is a good use of time.
Here some strategies for this:

You *must* do background reading (for things like MWL Foundational and Reading
Group) beforehand. This is essential for keeping sessions productive. If you
can’t, catch up and come to the next session. If you fall behind on one topic,
you can wait until the next topic.

Feel free to come only for areas (e.g. textbooks) or topics (e.g. chapters)
you’re interested in and want to cover.

If relevant, only one person should take notes. The organizers will generally do
this, though if anyone has a strong interest, we can alternate. Obviously no one
is forbidden from taking notes, but the way it's done in class is a waste of
time: everyone copying everything down takes the collective focus off of what’s
going on.

There could be a lot to read or do from week to week, and it may be tough to
keep up at times. However, we truly believe that there's a lot to be gained if
you put in the time and effort --- you get out what you put in.

## Compile a Reference

We hope to keep a running log online of core concepts we cover and good visualizations we come up with. This will be something everyone can access and print. Hopefully this will be more [a] relevant, [b] easy to understand, and [c] easy to access than flipping through textbooks.

## Feedback Early; Fail Fast

We doubt this will be perfect on the first meeting, and we want to open the forum for both discussions and anonymous feedback on the format—what we cover, how we cover it, how often we meet, who leads—from the get go.

## Safe Space for Extremely Dumb Questions 

I (Nelson) will do my best to lead the charge on this. My mathematics background
is thin, and I’m shaky on many of the fundamentals utilized in ML. No one should
feel embarrassed to admit not understanding any concept covered. There are
several requirements to meet this goal:

- no faculty should be present for these meetings
- the group should be kept intimate
- we must be vigilant in keeping each other positive and supportive.
