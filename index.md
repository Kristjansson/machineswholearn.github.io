Machines Who Learn is a student-led, for-students interest group for all things
machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science related. Our goal is
to support a tight-knit community of students interested in data by providing
them with a space to come together.

To this end, we're running 3 subgroups during Winter Quarter 2017, each focused
on a different facet of machine learning, AI, or data science.

- [MWL Foundational]({{ base }}/mwl_foundational) will focus on gleaning a
  deeper understanding of the core mathematical and statistical principles behind
  machine learning. We'll be working through
  [All of Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/) together
  during the quarter. We'll be meeting for 1-1.5 hours on Fridays at 5:30 PM in
  CSE 503.

- In the [MWL Reading Group]({{ base }}/mwl_reading_group), we'll be reading
  about current and past research in various topics within machine learning.
  We'll be meeting for 1.5-2 hours on Tuesdays at 6:30 PM in CSE 503.

- The [MWL Workshops]({{ base }}/mwl_workshops) will take participants through a
  tour of various popular machine learning algorithms with the goal of
  understanding how they work and implementing them from scratch to solidify
  these principles. We'll be meeting for an hour on Fridays at 4:00 PM in Allen
  Research Commons Red C.

If you're interested in joining us, feel free to come to any of our events
above and join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/machines-who-learn/join) or
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MachinesWhoLearn) to stay up to
date with what we're up to.
