Machines Who Learn is a student-led, for-students interest group for all things
machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science related. Our goal is
to support a tight-knit community of students interested in data by providing
them with a space to come together.

To this end, we're running 3 subgroups during Winter Quarter 2017, each focused
on a different facet of machine learning, AI, or data science.

- [MWL Foundational]({{ base }}/mwl_foundational) will focus on gleaning a
  deeper understanding of the core mathematical and statistical principles behind
  machine learning. We'll be working through
  [Linear Algebra Done Right](http://linear.axler.net/) together
  during the quarter. We'll be meeting on Tuesdays at 5:30 PM.

- In the [MWL Reading Group]({{ base }}/mwl_reading_group), we'll be reading
  about current and past research in various topics within machine learning.
  We'll be meeting on Thursdays at 5:30 PM.

- The [MWL Workshops]({{ base }}/mwl_workshops) will take participants through a
  tour of various popular machine learning algorithms with the goal of
  understanding how they work and implementing them from scratch to solidify
  these principles. We'll be meeting on Mondays at 5:30 PM.

If you're interested in joining us, feel free to come to any of our events
above and join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/machines-who-learn/join) or
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MachinesWhoLearn) to stay up to
date with what we're up to.

We're on GitHub at [github.com/MachinesWhoLearn](https://github.com/MachinesWhoLearn).
