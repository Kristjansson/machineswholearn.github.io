Machines Who Learn is a student-led, for-students interest group for all things
machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science related. Our goal is
to support a tight-knit community of students interested in the aforementioned
topics by forum for them to gather and share their interest together.

To this end, we're running 3 subgroups during Winter Quarter 2017, each focused
on a different facet of machine learning, AI, or data science.

- [MWL Foundational]({{ base }}/mwl_foundational) will focus
on gleaning a deeper understanding of the core mathematical and statistical
principles behind machine learning. We'll be working through
[All of Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/) together
during the quarter.

- In the [MWL Reading Group]({{ base }}/read_ml), we'll be reading about current
  and past research in various topics within machine learning.
